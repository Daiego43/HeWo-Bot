# HeWo-robot
After two years of working on a social robotics project, I have decided to conduct an opensource project for
the community to gather basic knowledge on how to design human robot interactions.

This is a repository for a series of implementations of open-source packages. In order to develop a 
minicharacter/assistant called HeWo. (Hello World)
