# HeWo Bot
## A personal robot project
After two years of working on a social robotics project, I have decided to conduct an opensource project for
the community to gather basic knowledge on how to design human robot interactions.

This is a repository for a series of implementations of open-source packages. In order to develop a 
minicharacter/assistant called HeWo the robot, HeWo-bot or simply hewo. 

The tools are already out there, we have to use them all.

And yes `HeWo` comes from `Hello World`.

## Devices used
- Raspberry Pi 4 with and Adeept Motor HAT (from rasptank robot). The HAT makes it easier to control stuff.
